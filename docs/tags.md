## 3.1 FAQs

### 3.1.1 Battery Drain

It should be defined to the client that by leaving the Actv8 listening module in the background it will result in a 2-4% battery drain per hour depending on the age of the iOS device.

### 3.1.2 First On First Off Microphone Usage

iOS manages the audio session singleton assigned to each application. When an app is listening in the background, it is iOS that decides when the app stops listening. When listening in the background, a time limit is set for the microphone usage. The time limit iOS needs for the audio session determine how long the microphone will stay on.

### 3.1.3 Red Audio Bar

When an application is using the microphone and is in the background, the iOS operating system places a red header across the top of the screen to remind the user that the microphone is on. For iPhone X devices, the red bar is replaced with a red pill in the top left of the device. This is a security feature of the operating system and cannot be suppressed or turned off.
